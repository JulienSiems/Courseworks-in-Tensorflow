# Tensorflow-models	

A couple of reference implementations for models I implemented/experimented with in tensorflow.
I managed to get them working for the autoencoder and variational autoencder using the beautiful class structure described by Danijar [here.](https://danijar.com/structuring-your-tensorflow-models/)
